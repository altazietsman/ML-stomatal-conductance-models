# ML-stomatal-conductance-models

This repository includes the code used for model development of ML models of stomatal conductance. All data used is also included.

## Input Data

Please note that two dataframes were used. The df.xlsx file includes data collected from a drought recovery study using two Eucalyptus hybrids. AllData_EcologyLetters_Figshare_v1_318.csv includes data compiled from a literature review done by Anderegg et al. (2018) and is accessible via the "Figshare Repository" with DOI 10.6084/39.figshre.6066449

## Model and dataframe
Please find an example of the dataframe required attached. The list of species names can be found in the species list file. Please note that the data needs to be standardized using the MinMaxScaler. A pickled version of the trained model will be sent on request.
